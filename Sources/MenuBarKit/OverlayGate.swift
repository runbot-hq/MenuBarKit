// OverlayGate.swift
// MenuBarKit
//
// MBKOverlayGate is the single source of truth for whether any overlay
// (SwiftUI sheet, NSOpenPanel, alert) is currently active on top of the popover.
//
// It is @Observable so SwiftUI views can read it, and @MainActor because
// all overlay state must mutate on the main thread.
//
// USAGE:
//   1. Create one MBKOverlayGate per popover.
//   2. Pass it to MBKPopoverController, MBKAnchoredSheet, MBKFilePicker, and mbkAlert.
//   3. The host app does not need to touch hasActiveOverlay directly —
//      MBKAnchoredSheet, mbkOpenFilePicker, and mbkAlert manage it automatically.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE OBJECT (not a Bool on the host's AppState):
//   The gate is MenuBarKit's concern, not the host app's. The host app should
//   not need to know about it at all — MBKAnchoredSheet, MBKFilePicker, and
//   MBKAlertModifier manage it automatically. The host's AppState can observe
//   it if needed, but does not own it.
//
// WHY A SINGLE BOOL (not a reference-counted integer):
//   In normal usage only one overlay (sheet OR file picker) can be live at a
//   time over the popover — a sheet blocks navigation and a file picker
//   attaches to the same window, so they cannot both be open simultaneously
//   through the supported API surface. A single bool is therefore sufficient.
//
//   The one exception is an alert presented while a sheet is open: alerts are
//   system modals that AppKit manages independently of the gate. MBKAlertModifier
//   handles this carefully — it records whether the gate was already armed at
//   alert-appear time, and only clears it on dismiss if no concurrent overlay
//   was live. See Alert.swift for full rationale.
//
//   If a future use-case genuinely requires concurrent overlays beyond this,
//   replace the Bool with an Int and use increment/decrement rather than
//   set/clear.
//
// WHY hasActiveOverlay IS public internal(set) var:
//   All write sites (MBKAnchoredSheet, mbkOpenFilePicker, MBKAlertModifier) live
//   inside the MenuBarKit module. internal(set) scopes the setter to the module,
//   which is exactly the right boundary: host apps get a read-only public view,
//   and all managed write sites within MenuBarKit can mutate it freely.
//
//   NOTE: private(set) was used briefly but is wrong here — private(set)
//   scopes the setter to the declaring type's body (and same-file extensions
//   only), not to the module. That would make the write sites in
//   AnchoredSheet.swift, FilePicker.swift, and Alert.swift compile errors.
//   internal(set) is the correct Swift access modifier for module-scoped
//   write access.
